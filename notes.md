# **Notes**

## CSS

- Use relative length for resposive design.
- Mind the selectors as they may cause some issues if not used correctly.
  
## CSS Rendering 
- When browser sees the css files it cascades the file according to the specificity and generates the final styles for the components.
- After that the DOM model is created.
  
## SASS
- Provides an extension to the features of CSS.
- Needs a parser to covert to final css file.
- It has two type of file extension :
  - SASS
  - SCSS - Sassy CSS 
- I will use SCSS since its syntax is quite simillar to that of CSS.
